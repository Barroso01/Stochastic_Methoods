# Stochastic_Methoods

Stochastic methods are an important field of study because they allow you to optimize and solve certain kinds of problems that would otherwise seem imposible to solve analiticaly (i.e deterministic, exact solutions). At its core, stochastic techniques make use of randomness and uncertanty to explore and obtain optimized solutions (local minima or maxima) within a search domain making them usefull in areas of engeneering, and complex sciences. 

Throught this repo, I put foward the codes that help to understand the vast field of study: 
- Coin.m : Flips a virtual coin using "random" numbers to ilustrate the concept of probability.
- Desplazamiento_estocastico.m: 1D movement with 50% probability of right and left.
- Deterministic_SIR_Model.mlx : function that solves a SIR model given a set of parameters (bet, ...).
- Diagrama_Bifurcacion.mlx : Famus fractal (chaos theory) $x_(n+1) = r x_n (1-x_n)$. [Personal Fav]
- Encriptar_mensaje.m : Crypt and decrypt a mesage.
